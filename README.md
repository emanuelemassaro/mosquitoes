# Mosquito dynamics with human mobility


This repository contains:
  
  1. A C++ code
  2. A python jupyter notebook 

The C++ code implement an Agent Based Model to simulate a mosquito borne disease in a urban environments. In particular, we simulate the urban environments as a squared grid NxN where each agent has 2 favorite cells (Home and Work). We simulate each day as two time-step in which the agents stay half a day in a cell and the other half in the other cell.  In each cell the humans can become infected because they are bitten by infected mosquito with a given probability.
